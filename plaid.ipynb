      "Top passages for Q0: [\"When Australian scientist Ruben Meerman lost 30 pounds last year, one question kept bugging him: Where did the fat go? The answer might seem obvious: It was burned up, as we say — which implies that it was transformed into heat or energy. The researchers chose to follow the path of these atoms when leaving the body. They found that when 10 kg of fat were oxidized, 8.4 kg were converted and excreted as carbon dioxide (CO2) via the lungs, and 1.6 kg became water (H20). In order for 10 kg of human fat to be oxidized, the researchers calculated that 29 kg of oxygen must be inhaled. Exercise also increases the oxidation of fat, which then leaves your body via your lungs, in the form of carbon dioxide, and your bodily fluids, in the form of water. What’s not so complex however, is how to optimize your metabolism—even if you don’t understand the exact mechanisms involved. The research conducted by a team at UNSW Science in Sydney calculated exactly what happens to our fat when we shed kilos, and revealed that doctor's leading theories are wrong - we don’t convert our missing mass into heat or energy, we breathe it out. If you eat less than you exhale, you’ll lose weight. If you’re trying to shed pounds, don’t worry too much about all of this talk of carbon atoms and oxidation. Balancing the calories you eat with the calories you expend is a sound strategy. In fact, it’s what Meerman did when he trimmed down last year. “I was drinking three cappuccinos made with full cream milk each day, and I’d hit 40 years of age,” he says. “Your metabolism slows a bit as you get older so you can’t consume as many calories and expect to stay slim. 1 When you lose weight, you exhale 84 percent of the lost fat in the form of carbon dioxide. The remaining 16 percent is excreted as water via bodily fluids.  By substituting one hour of sedentary lounging with one hour of moderate exercise—to increase your respiratory rate—your metabolic rate is increased sevenfold. Breathe deeply, Australian research shows that it’s going to take a lot of exhaling to get rid of that excess fat. FIONA MACDONALD. 17 DEC 2014. Despite society’s obsession with weight loss, a study has revealed that, surprisingly, most health professionals don’t actually know what happens to fat when we “lose it”. Consider intermittent fasting: If you’re insulin/leptin resistant and/or are overweight, boost your body's fat-burning potential by incorporating intermittent fasting. This is one of the most powerful approaches to reverse insulin resistance. It is only necessary to do until your insulin resistance resolves. Breathe deeply, Australian research shows that it’s going to take a lot of exhaling to get rid of that excess fat. Despite society’s obsession with weight loss, a study has revealed that, surprisingly, most health professionals don’t actually know what happens to fat when we “lose it”. To lose weight, you need to break down those triglycerides to access their carbon. The results showed that in order to completely breakdown 10kg of human fat, we need to inhale 29 kg of oxygen (and somewhere along the way, burn 94,000 calories). This reaction produces 28 kg of CO2 and 11 kg of water.\", \"The presence of communication amid scientific minds was equally important to the success of the Manhattan Project as scientific intellect was.

Scientists began to recognize that everything in the Universe is made out of energy. Ryan Biddulph Says: The most freeing aspect of being human is the fact we have a god-like part of us which molds our reality. The most confining aspect of being human is the fact we have a god-like part of us which molds our reality 😉. It really is that simple, difficult. Conversely, it would be wrong to relegate our experience to the world of illusion. It is very real, the only reality we know. If I kick a boulder my foot hurts. The solidness of the stone is real in my experience; so is the pain. The illusion comes when we confuse the image in our mind with the thing-in-itself. One great example that illustrates the role of consciousness within the physical material world (which we know not to be so physical) is the double slit experiment. This experiment has been used multiple times to explore the role of consciousness in shaping the nature of physical reality. Once we realize we are creating our own reality, we begin to see how we are truly manifesting our lives. Each day we will observe more and as Oprah says, she believes everything follows Newton’s 3rd Law Of Motion: “For Every Action, There Is An Equal And Opposite Reaction“. Reality is the state of things as they actually exist, rather than as they may appear or might be imagined. Reality includes everything that is and has been, whether or not it is observable or comprehensible. A still broader definition includes that which has existed, exists, or will exist. What does it mean that our physical material reality isn’t really physical at all? It could mean a number of things, and concepts such as this cannot be explored if scientists remain within the boundaries of the only perceived world existing, the world we see. The dictionary says that an illusion is a misleading image. So an illusion is something that has a particular reality to it, it’s just that this reality is a deceptive reality. Yet it seems to me that many people mistakenly think of an illusion as something that does not exist at all. You hear this kind of thing all the time. By contrast existence is often restricted solely to that which has physical existence or has a direct basis in it in the way that thoughts do in the brain. Reality is often contrasted with what is imaginary, illusory, delusional, (only) in the mind, dreams, what is false, what is fictional, or what is abstract. In Indian philosophy these two realities are sometimes referred to as the Absolute and the Relative. The Absolute is the underlying reality. It does not change according to who is experiencing it. It is, as it is, an independent reality. The Relative is the reality we observe, the reality generated in our minds.', \"The White House responded to Donald Trump keeping 1,000 jobs in the US by dropping a huge fact bomb that showed just how little Trump has accomplished compared to President Obama. The Hill reported that Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that the White House was pleased that the jobs were staying, then he added: FUN FACT: More net jobs have been created under Obama than both Bushes combined. The economy under President Obama seems difficult to defend — unless you put it in context. Here are the facts: When I took office, businesses were laying off 800,000 Americans a month. Today, our businesses are hiring 200,000 Americans a month. The White House responded to Donald Trump keeping 1,000 jobs in the US by dropping a huge fact bomb that showed just how little Trump has accomplished compared to President Obama. “If [Trump] is successful in doing that 804 more times, then he will meet the record number of manufacturing jobs” created during Obama’s eight years in office. Earnest went further, saying that the roughly 800,000 jobs he cited were new jobs created under Obama’s watch. Dec. 1, 2016. (The White House) During a press briefing on Dec. 1, 2016, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Mr. Trump would have to make 804 more announcements just like [the Carrier deal] to equal the standard of jobs in the manufacturing sector that were created under President Obama. Dec. 1, 2016. There were 805,000 manufacturing jobs that weren’t just protected or saved, but actually created while President Obama was in office. So President Obama has set a high standard, and President-elect Trump can meet that standard if this Carrier deal is completed in the way that he expects that it will be. More net jobs have been created under Obama — 5,142,000 as of the August jobs report — than under George H.W. Bush — 2,637,000 — and George W. Bush — 1,282,000 — combined, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. You should rightfully point out that crediting jobs created to a president exclusively is stupid. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that 805,000 manufacturing jobs have been created since President Barack Obama has been in office. In fact, there has been a net loss of 303,000 manufacturing jobs since January 2009. Earnest made the statement during a press briefing on Nov. 30. (For the record, the 10-million-jobs-added figure Obama cited is just private-sector jobs and excludes much of Obama's first year in office.) But we wondered if, in the past six years, U.S. job growth has surpassed other leading economies by such a wide margin. We've now created more than 10 million. The unemployment rate's come down faster than we could have anticipated. Just to give you some perspective, Bob, we've created more jobs in the United States than every other advanced economy combined since I came into office.. By many metrics, the United States has bounced back from the recession better than other advanced countries. There were 805,000 manufacturing jobs that weren't just protected or saved, but actually created while President Obama was in office. So President Obama has set a high standard, Earnest said. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence are visting the Carrier plant on Thursday.\", \"Put together, the United States constitutes roughly 40 percent of the world's military expenditures. For the period 2010–14, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) found that the United States was the world's largest exporter of major arms, accounting for 31 per cent of global shares. Fort Bragg is west of Fayetteville, North Carolina. It has a population of 238,646 that includes 52,280 active-duty soldiers. It covers 163,000 acres in area. Fort Campbell, on the border of Kentucky and Tennessee, has the second largest population of any U.S. military base, including 234,914 inhabitants. The American military has been. viewed as a form of national service, an occupation, a profession, a work-. place, a calling, an industry, and a set. of internal labor markets.1 Military. service has touched most American. families; nearly 26 million Americans. living today have served in the mili-.

Numbers of U.S. military service members vary by state, driven mostly by workforce levels at large bases. There were a total of 1.3 million active duty military and more than 800,000 reserve forces as of 2016, according to Defense Department data. Total active duty personnel for the five armed service were 471,397 for the Army, 326,276 for the Navy, 309,682 for the Air Force, 183,917 for the Marine Corps and 39,084 for the Coast Guard. The U.S. military is the world's second largest, after China's People's Liberation Army, and has troops deployed around the globe. From 1776 until September 2012, a total of 40 million people have served in the United States Armed Forces. Fort Bragg, Fort Campbell and Fort Hood are the largest U.S. military bases by population according to figures from 2013. Joint Base Lewis-McChord and Fort Benning are the next largest. It currently has 247,000 active personnel with an additional 57,900 in reserve. Japan also has 1,595 aircraft, the world's fifth largest air force, and 131 ships. Japan's military is limited by a peace clause in the constitution that makes it illegal for the country to have an offensive army. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out.
